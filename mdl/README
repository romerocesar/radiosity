This software was written at the Cornell Program of Computer Graphics,
and is provided as-is.  No support is available, and no guarantees are
made about its functionality.  To read more about the MDL file format,

These directories and files were constructed to facilitate implementation
of this library (and associated commands) on both the HP-UX and IRIX
operating systems using both the system and gnu compilers.  It should be
fairly straightforward to extend this functionality to other operating
systems.  Good luck!
